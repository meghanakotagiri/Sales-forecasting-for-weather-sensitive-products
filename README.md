# Sales-forecasting-for-weather-sensitive-products
To predict the sales of potentially weather-sensitive products (like umbrellas, bread and milk) around the time of major weather events (a weather event is any day in which more than an inch of rain or two inches of snow was observed) at different retail locations.

Problem Statement:
To predict the sales of potentially weather-sensitive products (like umbrellas, bread and milk)
around the time of major weather events (a weather event is any day in which more than an inch
of rain or two inches of snow was observed) at dierent retail locations.

Problem Description:
Supermarket stores like Walmart would like to know how much of each product is sold. It will
help them to know how much of each product should be put in stock. This is especially true in
times of extreme weather events. Intuitively, one can expect that the sales of umbrellas before
a big thunderstorm would increase. But itâ€™s difficult for replenishment managers to correctly
predict the level of inventory needed to avoid being out-of-stock or overstock during and after
that storm. This can be true for any other product that is potentially weather sensitive. We are
predicting the sales of products using Walmart data for different retail locations. This project is
a problem posted on Kaggle for Walmart.
